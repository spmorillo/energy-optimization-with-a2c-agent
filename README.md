# Energy Optimization with A2C agents

Energy optimization of Edge Computing scenarios using Deep Reinforcement Learning.

Edge Computing scenarios simulated with [Mercury](https://github.com/greenlsi/mercury_mso_framework). 

To run the experiments, this folder must be added to gride_model/samples.

Master's thesis project that earned honors. [Documentation](https://github.com/spmorillo/Research-Publications/tree/master/master's_thesis).
